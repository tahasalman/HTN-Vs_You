# HTN-Vs_You

## Brief Description
This is a simple 3D game that I created using the Unity Platform. Currently it only has one simple level where the player must compete against 
an AI agent to collect all the items in the alcoves of the maze.
The agent uses a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) to plan and execute its moves. In the future I plan to implement different models of AI to find out which has the best performance in this gaming context.

## How To Play

* Download the folder "BuiltGame"
* Execute the application file "HTN - Vs - You"

The player controlled-character is green and can be moved around with the arrow keys on your keyboard. To teleport you must press the spacebar.

## Have Fun!
